# define technical transport topics
# a transport is defined by a network adapter, a listening address and a port. google 'crosstalking' in case u run unix

transports:

- name: s0
  # address of network adapter,
  ifacAdr: 127.0.0.1
  mcastAdr: 230.9.10.10
  port: 45566

  dgramsize: 8000
  # needs to be true in order to run several processes on one machine
  loopBack: true

  # in java we like large buffers to minimize packet loss due to GC jitter
  receiveBufferSize: 25000000
  sendBufferSize: 640000

  #misc
  trafficClass: 8
  ttl: 2

- name: s1
  # address of network adapter,
  ifacAdr: 127.0.0.1

# topics bind service classes to a transport+topic (~topic). think of a topic being a
# separate independent communication  of a transport.
# Each transport can be divided into MCastSocketTransportQueue.MAX_SCOPE separate topics.
# Separation has the benefit, that in case of retransmission (oversaturation/delays) on one topic
# other scopes of the same transport are not affected.
